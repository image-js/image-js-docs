# API Changes

## üî∑ TypeScript Support

All APIs now have strict TypeScript definitions:

```ts
// Before: loose typing
const pixel = img.getPixel(x, y); // any[]

// After: strict typing
const pixel = img.getPixel(x, y); // number[] with proper channel count
```

This eliminates runtime type errors and provides better IntelliSense, autocomplete, and refactoring support in your IDE. Developers can now catch bugs at compile time rather than discovering them in production.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes

### Images

#### Loading and saving

`load()` and `save()` have been replaced with dedicated functions `read()` and `write()`.

```ts
//Before
import { Image } from 'image-js';
const img = await Image.load('cat.jpg');
img.save('newCat.jpg');
```

```ts
//After
import { read, write } from 'image-js';
const img2 = await read('cat.jpg');
await write('newCat.jpg', img);
```

There are also synchronous versions of these functions.

```ts
import { readSync, writeSync } from 'image-js';
const img = readSync('cat.jpg');
writeSync('newCat.jpg', img);
```

The new approach allows for better TypeScript inference, smaller bundle sizes through tree-shaking, and clearer API design where I/O operations are separate from image manipulation.

#### Creating

When creating a new image, unlike before, image's width and height must be specified.

```ts
import { Image } from 'image-js';

// Would work before, will throw an error in a new version.
const image = new Image();
// Works fine.
const image2 = new Image(10, 10);
```

This change makes the Image constructor more explicit by requiring you to specify the dimensions upfront, preventing potential errors from working with uninitialized or undefined-sized images

#### Coordinate System Changes

Coordinates are now represented using `Point` objects instead of arrays. This change affects methods that require coordinate input like cropping, drawing, pixel manipulation etc.

```ts
// Before
const croppedImage = img.crop({
  x:10,
  y:10
  width: 10,
  height: 10,
});
// After
const croppedImage = img.crop({
  origin: { column: 10, row: 10 },
  width: 10,
  height: 10,
});
```

It is a more explicit and self-documenting code. It also eliminates confusion about array order (column vs row).

### Masks

Binary images are now handled by a dedicated `Mask` class instead of Image with `kind: 'BINARY'`.

```ts
// Before
const mask = new Image(10, 10, { kind: 'BINARY' });
```

```ts
// After
const mask = new Mask(10, 10);
```

`Mask` provides better type safety, clearer API, and optimized performance for binary operations.

The new `Mask` class uses 1 byte per pixel (vs 8 pixels per byte), trading ~8x memory usage for significantly faster bit operations and simpler data manipulation.

### Regions of Interest

API for handling of regions of interest has also been changed.
ROI creation methods like `fromMask()` and `fromWatershed()` are now standalone functions `fromMask()` and `watershed()`.

```ts
//Before
import { Image } from 'image-js';

const roiManager = mask.getRoiManager();
roiManager.fromMask(mask);
const rois = roiManager.getRois();
```

```ts
//After
import { Image, fromMask } from 'image-js';

const roiManager = fromMask(mask);
const rois = roiManager.getRois();
```

This simplifies the process of creating a map of regions of interest and eliminates the need for a separate initialization step, providing a more direct and functional approach to ROI creation.

For more information, please, visit these tutorials:

- [Image segmentation with `threshold()` and `fromMask()`](../docs/Tutorials/Image%20segmentation%20with%20threshold)
- [Image segmentation with `watershed()`](../docs/Tutorials/Image%20segmentation%20with%20watershed)

### Sobel and Scharr filters

[Sobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator), [Scharr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator#Alternative_operators) filters are now combined into a single `derivative()` method.

```ts
// Before
const sobelX = img.sobelX();
const sobelY = img.sobelY();

// After
const sobelX = img.derivative({ filter: 'sobel' });
const sobelY = img.derivative({ filter: 'scharr' });
```

This filter now also accepts only grayscale images, since filters, like Sobel or Scharr, are used mainly on grayscale images to detect edges.

## üöÄ Performance fixes

Performance of multiple functions has been improved:

- `cannyEdgeDetector()`:
- `resize()`
- `transform()`
- `drawCircle()`

## üÜï New Features

### `transform()`

`transform()` allows applying a transformation matrix on the image. Which means that the image can now be translated, sheared, or warped based on the matrix that the user entered. `transform()` accepts both 2x3 and 3x3 matrices, depending on whether you want an affine transformation or a perspective one.

```ts
const matrix = getPerspectiveWarp(sourcePoints);
const warped = img.transform(matrix);
```

For more details, visit our [tutorial](/docs/Tutorials/Applying%20transform%20function%20on%20images) on how image transformations work how they can be used.

### Bicubic Interpolation

High-quality image scaling is now available with [bicubic interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation):

```ts
const resized = img.resize(800, 600, { interpolation: 'bicubic' });
```

**Use cases**: In many cases it gives a better quality when scaling images, especially for photographs.

### Prewitt filter

[Prewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewitt_operator) filter has been added to the `derivative()` filter.

```ts
const prewitt = img.derivative({ filter: 'prewitt' });
```

**Use cases**: Object detection, image segmentation, feature extraction. You can learn more about it [here](../docs/Features/Morphology/Morphological%20Gradient).

### Migration from deprecated methods

`warpingFourPoints()` has been removed. Now you have [`getPerspectiveWarp()`](../docs/Features/Geometry/Get%20Perspective%20Warp%20Matrix) that returns a matrix that can be applied on the image of interest in a new `transform()`.

```ts
// Before
const warped = img.warpingFourPoints(corners);

// After
const matrix = getPerspectiveWarp(corners);
const warped = img.transform(matrix);
```

**Use cases**: Rectification of a perspective angle of an image. You can learn more about it [here](../docs/Features/Geometry/Get%20Perspective%20Warp%20Matrix).

### `merge()`

`merge()`is the opposite of `split()`. It allows combining several one-channel images into one multi-channel image:

```ts
// Creates 3  grayscale images;
const img1 = new Image(2, 2, { colorModel: 'GREY', bitDepth: 8 }).fill(0);
const img2 = new Image(2, 2, { colorModel: 'GREY', bitDepth: 8 }).fill(0);
const img3 = new Image(2, 2, { colorModel: 'GREY', bitDepth: 8 }).fill(255);
// Creates RGB image. In this case, it creates blue 2x2 image.
const img4 = merge([img1, img2, img3]);
```

**Use cases**: Combination of multiple channels into one image after they were modified.

### `correctColor()`

This function performs color correction using machine learning to match an image's colors to reference standards.

```ts
const measured = [
  { r: 180, g: 120, b: 90 }, // Colors sampled from the image
  { r: 200, g: 200, b: 180 },
];
const reference = [
  { r: 255, g: 128, b: 64 }, // What those colors should actually be
  { r: 255, g: 255, b: 255 },
];
const corrected = image.correctColor(measured, reference);
```

**Use cases**: Camera calibration, white balance correction, matching images from different devices, scientific imaging standardization.

### `increaseContrast()`

This function increases image contrast by stretching the pixel value range to use the full available dynamic range.

```ts
const highContrast = image.increaseContrast();
```

The function automatically handles different color models, processing only relevant channels (excludes alpha in RGBA, processes only luminance in GREYA). Works with 8-bit and 16-bit images.

**Use cases**: Enhancing low-contrast images, improving visibility of subtle details, preparing images for analysis, correcting underexposed photographs.

### `pixelate()`

`pixelate()` creates a [pixelated effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixelation 'wikipedia link on pixelation') by dividing the image into square cells and filling each cell with a representative value.

```ts
const pixelatedImage = image.pixelate({
  cellSize: 8,
});
```

**Use cases**: Creating retro 8-bit effects, reducing image detail for artistic purposes, or preparing images for low-resolution displays.

### `cropRectangle()`

While `crop()` and `cropRectangle()` might appear similar. However, they provide provide different approaches to extracting image regions.
`crop()` - Standard rectangular cropping that maintains the original image orientation:

```ts
const cropped = image.crop({
  column: 10,
  row: 10,
  width: 50,
  height: 50,
});
// Returns a piece of image with the same
// orientation as the parent image.
```

`cropRectangle()` - Advanced cropping that extracts rotated rectangular regions defined by four corner points:

```ts
const points = [
  { row: 30, column: 30 },
  { row: 60, column: 60 },
  { row: 90, column: 30 },
  { row: 60, column: 0 },
];
const rotatedCrop = image.cropRectangle(points);
// Returns a cropped oriented rectangle.
```

Use `crop()` for simple rectangular selections aligned with image axes, and `cropRectangle()` when you need to extract tilted or rotated rectangular regions.

### `drawMarkers()`

Similarly to `drawPoints()`, `drawMarkers()` allows user to annotate an image. However,`drawMarkers()` creates visible markers (crosses, circles, squares, triangles)
which gives a more prominent visual annotation. This gives a better alternative for highlighting or marking features.

```ts
const points = [
  { row: 50, column: 100 },
  { row: 150, column: 200 },
];

const annotated = image.drawMarkers(points, {
  shape: 'circle', // Shape of a marker
  size: 5,
  color: [255, 0, 0], // Red markers
  filled: true,
});
```

Each marker is drawn centered on the specified point coordinates. The function creates a new image without modifying the original, making it ideal for creating annotated versions while preserving source data.

**Use cases**: Marking detected features, annotating regions of interest, visualizing analysis results, creating overlays for presentations.

### `Stack` features

The Stack class has been significantly expanded with new methods for batch processing and statistical analysis of image collections.

#### Array-like Operations

A user can now filter images based on custom criteria using `filter()`:

```ts
// Create sample images
const img1 = new Image(2, 2, { colorModel: 'GREY', bitDepth: 8 }).fill(0);
const img2 = new Image(2, 2, { colorModel: 'GREY', bitDepth: 8 }).fill(0);
const img3 = new Image(2, 2, { colorModel: 'GREY', bitDepth: 8 }).fill(255);

const stack = new Stack([img1, img2, img3]);

// Filter images where top-left pixel is white (255)
const brightImages = stack.filter((img) => img.getValue(0, 0, 0) === 255);
// Result: [img3]
```

One can also apply the same operation to every image in the stack with `map()`:

```ts
// Set top-left corner to gray (125) on all images
const modifiedStack = stack.map((img) => {
  img.setValue(0, 0, 0, 125);
  return img;
});
```

#### Statistical Operations

It is now possible to generate a median image from the entire stack - useful for noise reduction and background subtraction:

```ts
const medianImage = stack.medianImage();
```

or create a cumulative sum of all images in the stack:

```ts
const summedImage = stack.sum();
```

Access specific pixel values from any image in the stack using two convenient methods:

_By Coordinates_

```ts
const stackIndex = 1; // Second image in stack.
const row = 0;
const column = 0;
const channel = 0;

// Get pixel value at specific coordinates.
const pixelValue = stack.getValue(stackIndex, row, column, channel);
```

_By Linear Index_

```ts
const stackIndex = 1;
const pixelIndex = row * image.width + column; // Convert 2D to 1D index.
const channel = 0;

// Get the same pixel value using linear indexing.
const pixelValue = stack.getValueByIndex(stackIndex, pixelIndex, channel);
```

**Use Cases**: Time-lapse analysis, scientific imaging.

### Image comparison features

ImageJS now has several methods to check feature similarities between two images. For instance, let's take `computeSsim()`.
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) is a value between -1 and 1 that measures how similar two images are in terms of:

- Luminance

- Contrast

- Structure

`computeSsim()` also has an opposite function `computeDssim()`. It checks _dissimilarities_ between two images.

```ts
// 3x3 grayscale image
const image = new Image(3, 3, {
  colorModel: 'GREY',
  data: new Uint8Array([5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 15, 15, 15]),
});
const other = image;

console.log(computeSsim(image, other).mssim); // equals to 1, since images are the same.
console.log(computeDssim(image, other)); // equals to 0, since function is the opposite of SSIM.
```

ImageJS also includes such metrics like RMSE([Root Mean Square Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation),measures the average magnitude of pixel differences between two images, giving more weight to larger errors) and PSNR( [Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio), derived from MSE. It expresses the ratio between the maximum possible pixel value and the error (MSE))

```ts
// Rmse check
computeRmse(image, other);
//PSNR check
computePsnr(image, other);
```

**Use cases**: image quality measurement, detection of changes, or to evaluate visual similarity in tasks like compression, restoration, recognition, and tracking.
