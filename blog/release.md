We're excited to announce the release of image-js-typescript, a complete rewrite of the popular image-js library. This new version brings modern TypeScript support and a more intuitive API while maintaining the powerful image processing capabilities you love.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è API Changes

### Stricter typing

```js
// Before
const pixel = img.getPixel(x, y); // any[]

// After
const pixel = img.getPixel(x, y); // number[] with proper typing
```

### Changed the way images are loaded and created

Static method `load` for reading and writing images has been replaced with dedicated functions `read` and `write`. There are also synchronous versions of these functions.(add more explanation)

```ts
javascript; // Before
import { Image } from 'image-js';
const img = await Image.load('cat.jpg');
```

```ts
// After
import { readSync, read } from 'image-js';
const img = readSync('cat.jpg');
// or
const img = await read('cat.jpg');
```

### Distinction between Image and Mask objects

In the new version of ImageJS binary images(masks) becomes a separate class.

```ts
// Before
const mask = new Image(10, 10, { kind: 'BINARY' });
```

```ts
// After
const mask = new Mask(10, 10);
```

In previous versions binary images (masks) had 8 pixels of data stacked in one byte.The new version changes that. Now Masks' data reserves 1 byte per pixel.
It improves and facilitates data readability and editing.

### New features

- Bicubic interpolation has been added as interpolation option
- Canny Edge Detector filter has been added
- `transform` function now accepts 3x3 matrices as well as 2x3
- `warpingFourPoints` function has been deprecated and now `getPerspectiveWarp` returns a matrix that can be used in a new `transform()` function.

### Refactored functions

Several methods have been renamed. Some notable changes:

- `paint*` methods(`drawPoligon()`, `paintPolyline()` etc.) are now `draw\*` methods(`drawPolyline()`,`drawPoligon()` etc.).
- `copy()` ‚Üí `clone()`
- `clearBit()` ‚Üí `setBit()`,`setBitByPoint()`,`setBitByCoord()`
- `getLocalMaxima` ‚Üí `getExtrema`
- `getChannel()`‚Üí`extractChannel()`

### Bug fixes

- Fixed perspectiveWarp functioning

### Removed Features

- `countAlphaPixel` was removed.
- `paintLabels` was removed.

### Configuration Changes

Default parameters: Some filter defaults have changed for better results
Color space handling: Improved but different color space conversion behavior
