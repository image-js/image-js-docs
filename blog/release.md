We're excited to announce the release of image-js-typescript, a complete rewrite of the popular image-js library. This new version brings TypeScript support and a more intuitive API while maintaining the powerful image processing capabilities you love.

# API Changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes

### Changed the way images are loaded and created

Static method `load` for reading and method `save` for writing images have been replaced with dedicated functions `read` and `write`.

```ts
//Before
import { Image } from 'image-js';
const img = await Image.load('cat.jpg');
img.save('newCat.jpg');
```

```ts
//After
import { read, write } from 'image-js';
const img2 = await read('cat.jpg');
await write('newCat.jpg', img);
```

There are also synchronous versions of these functions.(add more explanation)

```ts
import { readSync, writeSync } from 'image-js';
const img = readSync('cat.jpg');
writeSync('newCat.jpg', img);
```

The new approach allows for better TypeScript inference, smaller bundle sizes through tree-shaking, and clearer API design where I/O operations are separate from image manipulation.

### Distinction between Image and Mask objects

Binary images are now handled by a dedicated Mask class instead of Image with `kind: 'BINARY'`.

```ts
// Before
const mask = new Image(10, 10, { kind: 'BINARY' });
```

```ts
// After
const mask = new Mask(10, 10);
```

Dedicated Mask class provides better type safety, clearer API, and optimized performance for binary operations.

The new Mask class uses 1 byte per pixel (vs 8 pixels per byte), trading ~8x memory usage for significantly faster bit operations and simpler data manipulation.

### Modification of Sobel and Scharr filters

[Sobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator),[Scharr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator#Alternative_operators) filters are now combined into a single `derivative()` method.

```ts
// Before
const sobelX = img.sobelX();
const sobelY = img.sobelY();

// After
const sobelX = img.derivative({ filter: 'sobel' });
const sobelY = img.derivative({ filter: 'scharr' });
```

This filter also now accepts only grayscale images, since filters like Sobel or Scharr are used mainly on grayscale images to detect edges.

### Enhanced TypeScript Support

All APIs now have strict TypeScript definitions:

```ts
ts; // Before: loose typing
const pixel = img.getPixel(x, y); // any[]

// After: strict typing
const pixel = img.getPixel(x, y); // number[] with proper channel count
```

### Method Renaming

Several methods have been renamed for consistency:

**Drawing methods**:

img.paintPolyline() ‚Üí img.drawPolyline()
img.paintPolygon() ‚Üí img.drawPolygon()
img.paintCircle() ‚Üí img.drawCircle()

**Other methods**:

img.copy() ‚Üí img.clone()
img.clearBit() ‚Üí img.setBit()
img.getLocalMaxima() ‚Üí img.getExtrema()
img.getChannel() ‚Üí img.extractChannel()

Consistent naming follows common conventions (draw\* for rendering, clone for copying objects).

## üÜï New Features

### `transform()` function

The `transform` function allows applying transformation matrix on the image. Which means that the image can now be translated or sheared or warped based on the matrix that the user entered. `transform()` function accepts both 2x3 and 3x3 matrices, depending on whether you want an affine transformation or a perspective one.

```ts
const matrix = getPerspectiveWarp(sourcePoints);
const warped = img.transform(matrix);
```

For more details visit our [tutorial](/docs/Tutorials/Applying transform function on images.md) on how image transformations work.

### Bicubic Interpolation

High-quality image scaling is now available with [bicubic interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation):

```ts
const resized = img.resize(800, 600, { interpolation: 'bicubic' });
```

**Use case**: In many cases it gives a better quality when scaling images, especially for photographs.

### Canny Edge Detection

[Canny Edge Detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector.md) is an advanced edge detection filter for computer vision applications:

```ts
const edges = img.cannyEdgeDetector({
  lowThreshold: 50,
  highThreshold: 150,
});
```

**Use case**: Object detection, image segmentation, feature extraction. You can learn more about it [here](../docs/Features/Morphology/Canny Edge Detector.md).

### Prewitt filter

[Prewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewitt_operator) filter has been added to the `derivative()` filter.

```ts
const prewitt = img.derivative({ filter: 'prewitt' });
```

**Use case**: Object detection, image segmentation, feature extraction. You can learn more about it [here](../docs/Features/Morphology/Morphological Gradient.md).

### Migration from deprecated methods:

`warpingFourPoints` function has been deprecated.Now you have [`getPerspectiveWarp`](../docs/Features/Geometry/Get Perspective Warp Matrix.md) function that returns a matrix that can be applied on an image of interest in a new `transform` function.

```ts
// Before
const warped = img.warpingFourPoints(corners);

// After
const matrix = getPerspectiveWarp(corners);
const warped = img.transform(matrix);
```

**Use case**: Rectification of a perspective angle of an image. You can learn more about it [here](../docs/Features/Geometry/Get Perspective Warp Matrix.md).

# üóëÔ∏è Removed Features

The following deprecated features have been removed:

- `countAlphaPixel()` - Use custom pixel counting with getPixel()
- `paintLabels()` - Feature was removed due to poor performance.
- `warpingFourPoints()` - Use `getPerspectiveWarp()` + `transform()`.
