# Getting started

ImageJS is a versatile and powerful library written in TypeScript for image processing and analysis. It gives a user a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms for manipulating, enhancing, and understanding images not only within Node.js but also across all popular browsers.

## System requirements

ImageJS is a modern library and does not actively support outdated runtimes.
One of the following is required:

- An officially supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
- A modern and up-to-date web browser.

## Installation

Installation of ImageJS is straight-forward. Use the terminal to install the package:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```
npm install image-js
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```
yarn add image-js
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Loading your first image

There are two ways of loading an image to process it, depending on the way the user is operating:

### Loading and saving an image from Node.js

Local loading uses the `readSync` or `read` function with a filepath:

```ts
import { read, readSync } from 'image-js';

const parsedImage = readSync('example.jpg');
const parsedImageAsync = await read('example.jpg');
```

:::tip
Node.js can also load an image via `fetchURL`. To get more information, take a look at the next section.
:::

Once the image is loaded, it returns an instance of the `Image` class, so its methods can be applied.

```ts
const invertedImage = parsedImage.invert();
```

To save an image use `writeSync` or `write` function:

```ts
import { writeSync, write } from 'image-js';

writeSync('out.png', image);
await write('out.png', image);
```

Image format is automatically identified based on the extension. In this case it's `'.png'` so the image is saved as a PNG file.

So, in the end you should get a code like this:

```ts
import { readSync, writeSync } from 'image-js';

const parsedImage = readSync('example.jpg');
const image = parsedImage.invert();
writeSync('example.png', image);
```

### Loading an image from a web browser

To load an image via a browser, you may use the `fetchURL` function:

```ts
import { fetchURL } from 'image-js';

let image = await fetchURL('https:://example.com/image.jpg');
image = image.grey();
```
