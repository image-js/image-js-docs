The user can not only apply filters on the images but also rotate and rescale them

## Rescale

Image rescaling, also known as image resizing or image scaling, is an image processing technique used to change the dimensions (size) of an image while maintaining its aspect ratio. Rescaling can involve both enlarging and reducing the image's size. The goal of image rescaling is to adapt an image to fit within specific dimensions, whether it's for display, printing, or other purposes.

- **width** - the output image width

- **height** - the output image height

- **xFactor** - a factor by which the image will be scaled horizontally

- **yFactor** - a factor by which the image will be scaled vertically

- **preserveAspectRatio** - a boolean parameter that lets the user decide whether one wants to keep initial proportions of the image.

- **interpolationType** - provides the algorithm which will handle image borders

## Rotate

Image-js can also rotate images by 90 degrees.
