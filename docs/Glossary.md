### Alpha channel

An alpha channel is a supplementary channel that is often used in digital images to store and represent information about the transparency or opacity of each pixel. It is commonly associated with color images, and it allows for the creation of images with varying levels of transparency or translucency, which is essential for various graphic design, visual effects, and image composition tasks.

### Bit depth

Bit depth, also known as color depth or pixel depth, refers to the number of bits used to represent the color of each pixel in a digital image. Bit depth directly impacts the number of colors or shades of gray that can be displayed in an image. A higher bit depth allows for a greater range of colors, resulting in more detailed and accurate representations, while a lower bit depth limits the color variations that can be shown

### Channel

In the context of digital images, a channel refers to one of the separate grayscale or color components that together make up the complete image. Channels are a fundamental concept in image processing and manipulation, especially in color images, where each channel represents a primary color or a specific property of the image.The most common color spaces used in images are RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black).

### Convolution

[Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution 'wikipedia link on convolution') is a mathematical operation that is widely used in various fields, including image processing, signal processing, and mathematics itself. In the context of image processing, convolution is a fundamental operation used to apply filters, masks, or kernels to an image. It is used for tasks such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more.

The convolution operation involves sliding a small matrix (filter, kernel, or mask) over an input image and calculating a new value for each pixel by performing a mathematical operation between the values in the filter and the corresponding pixel neighborhood in the image.

Here's how the convolution operation works:

Filter (Kernel) Definition: A filter or kernel is a small matrix of numerical values. The size of the filter determines the extent of the neighborhood that is considered for each pixel. Common filter sizes are 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7.

Overlaying the Filter: The filter is placed over the input image, with its center aligned to the current pixel under consideration.

Pixel Multiplication and Summation: For each element in the filter, the corresponding pixel values in the image neighborhood are multiplied with the filter values. The results of these multiplications are then summed up to produce a new value for the current pixel.

Replacing the Pixel Value: The calculated value becomes the new value for the current pixel location in the output image.

### ROI(Region of Interest)

- A Region of Interest (ROI) refers to a specific area or portion within a larger space or image that is of particular interest for analysis, processing, or further investigation. In various fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, remote sensing, and more, identifying and isolating regions of interest can help in focusing computational resources and analysis efforts on the relevant parts of the data.

### Roi map

An ROI (Region of Interest) map, also known as an ROI mask or segmentation map, is a binary image that highlights specific regions or areas of interest within a larger image. It is a common concept in image processing and computer vision, where you want to isolate and identify certain objects, features, or regions for further analysis, manipulation, or processing.

### Kernel

In image processing, a [Kernel](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)> 'wikipedia link on kernel'), also known as a filter or mask, is a small matrix of numerical values that is used to perform operations such as convolution on an image. Kernels are a fundamental concept in various image processing techniques and are employed to modify, enhance, or extract specific features from an image.

### Morphology

Morphology in image processing is a set of operations that deal with the shape and structure of objects within an image. It involves manipulating the geometric properties of image elements, such as pixels or groups of pixels, to extract meaningful information, enhance features, or remove noise. Morphological operations are often used in tasks like image filtering, object detection, image segmentation, and more.

### Image noise

[Image noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise 'wikipedia link on image noise') refers to random variations in pixel values within an image, which can lead to unwanted visual artifacts and reduced image quality. It is often caused by various factors during image acquisition, transmission, or processing. Image noise can obscure details, reduce contrast, and make it harder to extract meaningful information from an image.

### Intensity

Intensity, in the context of image processing and computer vision, refers to the brightness or darkness of a pixel or region within an image. It quantifies the amount of light or energy that a pixel or area emits, reflects, or transmits. Intensity values are typically represented numerically and can be single-channel (grayscale) or multi-channel (color) depending on whether the image is grayscale or color.

In a grayscale image:

Each pixel has a single intensity value that usually ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white) in an 8-bit image. Higher values represent brighter areas.
In a color image:

Each pixel consists of intensity values for different color channels. In an RGB image, these channels are red, green, and blue.
Each color channel typically has an intensity value ranging from 0 (no contribution of that color) to 255 (maximum contribution of that color).
