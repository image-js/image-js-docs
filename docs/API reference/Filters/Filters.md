# Filters

[Image filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing#Filtering 'wikipedia link on image filtering') are techniques or algorithms applied to digital images in order to modify their appearance, enhance certain features, or extract specific information from them. Image filters work by altering the pixel values of an image based on predefined mathematical operations or transformations. These filters can be used for various purposes, such as artistic effects, noise reduction, image enhancement, edge detection, and more.
