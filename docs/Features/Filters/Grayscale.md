_Converts color image into shades of gray._

[üñºÔ∏è Image options and parameters of `grayscale` method](https://image-js.github.io/image-js-typescript/classes/Image.html#grey 'github.io link')

[Grayscale filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale 'Wikipedia link on grayscale filter'), often called a black-and-white filter, is an image processing technique used to convert a colored image into a grayscale version. In a grayscale image, each pixel is represented by a single intensity value, typically ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white), with various shades of gray in between. This process removes color information and retains only the brightness information of the image.

The grayscale filter essentially eliminates the color information from the image and retains only the luminance or brightness values. This type of image is often used in situations where color is not essential for understanding or conveying the visual information. Grayscale images can emphasize the tonal contrast and structural details of a scene, making them particularly useful for tasks like analyzing textures, patterns, and lighting conditions.

### Kinds of images compatible with algorithm

| -------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| `bitDepth`     | number of bits per channel | `[8,16]`        |
| `components`   | number of components       | `[3]`           |
| `alpha`        | is alpha channel allowed   | `true`          |

<b>Implementation</b>
</summary>

Here's how grayscale filter is implemented in ImageJS:

_Color Channel Separation_: If the image is in color (composed of red, green, and blue channels), the grayscale filter typically processes each color channel separately. This is done to ensure that the brightness values are determined from the original color intensities.

_Pixel Transformation_: For each pixel in each color channel (red, green, and blue), a transformation is applied to calculate its grayscale intensity value. A common approach is to calculate the weighted average of the color channels' intensities, but there are multiple algorithms available for usage.

_Applying intensity_: After calculating the grayscale intensity, the resulting value is then assigned to a new copy of an image. Depending whether user keeps alpha or merges it, the value is calculated differently.
