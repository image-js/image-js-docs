# Filters

[Image filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing#Filtering 'wikipedia link on image filtering') are techniques or algorithms applied to digital images in order to modify their appearance, enhance certain features, or extract specific information from them. Image filters work by altering the pixel values of an image based on predefined mathematical operations or transformations. These filters can be used for various purposes, such as artistic effects, noise reduction, image enhancement, edge detection, and more.

### Methods that can be applied on Images only

- [Grayscale](Grayscale.md 'internal link on grayscale')

- [Blur](Blur.md 'internal link on blur')

- [gaussianBlur](./Gaussian%20Blur.md 'internal link on gaussianBlur')

- [Gradient](./Gradient.md 'internal link on gradient')

- [Derivative](./Derivative.md 'internal link on derivative')

- [Median](./Median.md 'internal link on median')

- [level](./Level.md 'internal link on level')

- [pixelate](./Pixelate.md 'internal link on pixelate')

### Methods that can be applied on Masks only

- [and](./Logical%20conjunction.md 'internal link on and')

- [or](./Logical%20disjunction.md 'internal link on or')

### Methods that can be applied on Images or Masks

- [invert](./Invert.md 'internal link on invert')
