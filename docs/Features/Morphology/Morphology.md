[Morphological operations](../../Glossary.md#morphology 'internal link on morphology') are based on a structuring element, which is a small shape or pattern used as a template for modifying the pixels in an image. The structuring element is typically a small binary array that defines the area around a pixel to consider during the operation.

Morphological operations are simple yet powerful tools that play a significant role in various image processing tasks, especially in situations where the shapes and structures of objects are important.
