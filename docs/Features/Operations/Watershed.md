_Separates and identifies distinct regions or objects within an image through gradient information and marker-based segmentation._

[üñºÔ∏è Image options and parameters of `waterShed` function](https://image-js.github.io/image-js-typescript/functions/waterShed.html 'github io link')

[Watershed filter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)> 'wikipedia link on watershed') is a way of identifying objects by finding image's extreme points(minima or maxima) in terms of intensity and filling these spaces with color(label). The process reminds geological [watershed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_divide 'wikipedia link on drainage divide'), which is the origin of algorithm's name. In order for the "water" not to go overboard and stay within the limits of the region, a threshold of [intensity](../../Glossary.md#intensity 'internal link on glossary') is set. It can be set by mask, or by threshold value, all depends on the way the function is implemented.

The watershed algorithm is particularly useful for segmenting objects in images, especially when objects are close to each other.

:::caution
It is important to remember that watershed filter does not return an image, nor mask. It returns a `RoiMapManager`, an object which stores the location and data about each region of interest.

:::caution
If you look for bright-colored ROIs, then either look for maximum points or invert image before applying watershed.

<b>Implementation</b>
 </summary>

Here's how watershed filter is implemented in ImageJS:

_Grayscale an image(if necessary)_: an image should have 1 channel for watershed filter to work. If that's not the case, an image must be grayscaled.

_Set a threshold or use mask_: threshold needs to be set in order for minima not to fill the whole image and stop at intensity border of a region. It can also use a mask to situate general areas of interest.

_Find extrema_: extrema get calculated by checking each pixel's intensity with its neighbors. Once it is the most extreme(lowest or highest) value, it becomes an extrema and a point of origin for a region of interest.

_Sort pixels by their intensity_: ImageJS uses a priority queue to sort elements.

_Indicate created regions of interest on a ROI map_: Created regions are stored in a new ROI map.
