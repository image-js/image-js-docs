_Separates and identifies distinct regions or objects within an image through gradient information and marker-based segmentation._

[üñºÔ∏è Image options and parameters of `waterShed` function](https://image-js.github.io/image-js-typescript/functions/waterShed.html 'github io link')

[Watershed filter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)> 'wikipedia link on watershed') is a way of identifying objects by finding image's lowest points(minima) in terms of intensity and filling these spaces with color(label). The process reminds geological [watershed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_divide 'wikipedia link on drainage divide'), which is the origin of algorithm's name. In order for the "water" not to go overboard and stay within the limits of the region, a threshold of [intensity](../../Glossary.md#intensity 'internal link on glossary') is set. It can be set by mask, or by threshold value, all depends on the implementation.

The watershed algorithm is particularly useful for segmenting objects in images, especially when there are variations in intensity or color.

:::caution
It is important to remember that watershed filter does not return an image, nor mask. It returns a `RoiMapManager` object which stores the location of each region of interest.

<b>Implementation</b>
 </summary>

Here's how watershed filter is implemented in ImageJS:

_Blur and grayscale an image(if necessary)_: an image should be grayscale for watershed filter to work. It is also a good practice to blur an image to remove some of its noise for more precise results(see [blur](../Filters/Blur.md) for more information).

| Image Input                                          | Output without blur                                                  | Output with blur                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

_Find minima_: the first step is to find minima points. You need to use `getExtrema` to while precising what kind of points you are looking for. The points should be additionally filtered to remove repeating minima close by.

:::caution
If you look for bright-colored ROIs, then either look for maximum points or invert image before applying watershed.
:::

_Set a threshold or use mask_: threshold needs to be set in order for minima not to fill the whole image and stop at intensity border of a region. It can also use a mask to situate general areas of interest.

_Sort pixels by their intensity_: ImageJS uses a priority queue to sort elements.

_Indicate created regions of interest on a ROI map_: Created regions are stored in a new ROI map.
