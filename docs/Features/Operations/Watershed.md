_Separates and identifies distinct regions or objects within an image through gradient information and marker-based segmentation._

[Watershed filter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)> 'wikipedia link on watershed') is a way of identifying objects by finding image's lowest points(minima) in terms of intensity and filling these spaces with color(label). The process reminds geological [watershed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_divide 'wikipedia link on drainage divide'), which is the origin of algorithm's name. In order for the "water" not to go overboard and stay within the limits of the region, a threshold of [intensity](../../Glossary.md#intensity 'internal link on glossary') is set.

The watershed algorithm is particularly useful for segmenting objects in images, especially when there are variations in intensity or color.

:::caution
It is important to remember that watershed filter does not return an image, nor mask. It returns a `RoiMapManager` object which stores the location of each region of interest.

<b>Implementation</b>
 </summary>

Here's how watershed filter is implemented in ImageJS:

_Blur and grayscale an image(if necessary)_: an image should be grayscale for watershed filter to work. It is also a good practice to blur an image to remove some of its noise.

_Find minima_: the first step is to find minima points. You need to use `getExtrema` to while precising what kind of points you are looking for. The points should be additionally filtered to remove repeating minima close by.

:::caution
If you look for bright-colored ROIs, then either look for maximum points or invert image before applying watershed.
:::

_Set a threshold or use mask_: threshold needs to be set in order for minima not to fill the whole image and stop at intensity border of a region. It can also use a mask to situate general areas of interest.
_Sort pixels by their intensity_: ImageJS uses a priority queue to sort elements.

_Indicate created regions of interest on a ROI map_: Created regions are indicated on a new ROI map.
