[Convex Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull 'wikipedia link on convex hull').
The convex hull is a way of characterizing the shape of an image by determining which pixels are adjacent to other pixels of the same intensity. This is a good way to find holes and convex features in an image.
